# Changelog

All notable changes to `machynka-eu` will be documented here.

This project follows semantic versioning once published.

## 2.1.0

- The language switcher is the package's `LocaleSwitcher` rather than a hand-built popover, its chip sized through `shell.language.trigger`.
- Section headings are a `heading.variants.section` entry in the frontend config instead of a class with four breakpoint overrides, and every stacked or inline wrapper in the sections, panels, property cards and accommodation pages is a package layout utility. Images and map embeds sit in the package's `frame`, badges and room tags are `pill`s, and small caps labels are `label-caps`.
- Panels, cards and rooms take their heading and body styling from element rules scoped to the container rather than a class per line of text, the six copies of the square icon tile become one, and both map embeds share a frame.
- Half the stylesheet is gone: 1878 lines across 14 files down to 955 across 11, and 182 class names down to 81.

## 2.0.0

- The site is now `machynka.eu`. The product identity, the contact email and every generated URL follow the new domain, and `machynka.cz`, `www.machynka.cz` and `penzion.machynka.cz` redirect permanently to it, keeping the path.
- Penzion Machynka lists 7 rooms, not 18. The homepage room total is now added up from the accommodation data instead of being written out by hand, so the headline figure cannot drift from the rooms actually listed.
- The Libuše apartments' room names drop the trailing property name: "Studio č. 9 Libuše" is just "Studio č. 9" on the page that is already about Libuše.
- Moved to @trebired/frontend 13.44.0 and took its new components. The hand-written card table, which drew its dividers with nth-child borders to stop neighbours doubling up, is now the package's `HairlinePanel`. Every page section is the package's `Section` with a tone instead of a repeated flex-centre-and-pad shell, and the footer is the package's `SiteFooter`.

## 1.6.5

- `penzion.machynka.cz` now redirects permanently to `machynka.cz`, keeping the path, so old links to the guesthouse subdomain land on the same page of the main site.

## 1.6.4

- Moved to `@trebired/frontend` 13.14.0. Select cards now switch on click and from the keyboard, and headings take their level from nesting. This site renders neither, so nothing on it changes.

## 1.6.3

- Moved to `@trebired/frontend` 13.11.1, which changes the graph cards this site does not use. The header is unchanged.

## 1.6.2

- The header keeps its 5rem bar, 3.5rem logo and link sizes, which `@trebired/frontend` 13.9.0 now fixes for every site rather than reading from this repository. Nothing here changes; the other sites match this header.

## 1.6.1

- The menu toggle keeps its 3rem button and 2rem icon, which `@trebired/frontend` 13.8.1 now fixes for every site instead of reading a per-site token.

## 1.6.0

- The header and its mobile menu come from `SiteHeader` in `@trebired/frontend` 13.8.0 instead of this repository. The header reads the same: the same bar, the same links, the same phone number and language switcher, and the same menu under the toggle. The site now describes the header as a brand, a list of links and the actions beside them, and its look through `components.shell.header` tokens, so the header and the menu behave the same here as on the other sites.

## 1.5.1

- The language menu takes each language's name from `languageName` in `@trebired/frontend` 13.7.0, which names a language in that language (Čeština, English). The menu read the same before; a language added later is now named correctly without a hand-written label.
- Moved to `@trebired/logger` 3.0.0. It saves logs to SQLite and needs Bun to save them; this site logs to the console only, so nothing else changes.

## 1.5.0

- Removed the Booking.com buttons from the accommodation hero and price panel, along with their links and copy. Reservations are taken by phone or e-mail only.
- Removed the 24/7 support figure from the home hero, which was not true. The hero stats now show rooms and properties.
- The "Rezervovat telefonicky/e-mailem" button on each accommodation page now scrolls to that page's contact details (check-in and check-out, reception address, phone numbers, and location) instead of leaving for the home page contact section.
- Fixed the favicon staying dark in a dark browser. Chromium took the `.ico`, which cannot follow the color scheme, over the light and dark svg variants. `@trebired/frontend` 13.1.13 serves one adaptive favicon built from both variants.
- Removed a stale `overrides` entry for `@trebired/logger` that conflicted with the direct dependency and made installs fail.

## 1.4.0

- Switching language no longer reloads or changes the URL. 1.2.0 changed language by navigating to `/en`. The language menu now re-renders the page in place, the saved language is shown before the application bundle runs, and moving between pages keeps it. Built on `@trebired/frontend` 13.1.2.
- The `/en` pages remain for search engines only, so both languages stay indexed with `hreflang`. Visitors are never sent there; someone arriving from a search result sees their saved language if they have one.

## 1.3.1

- Fixed the gallery lightbox opening to an empty dark overlay. 1.3.0 moved to the `@trebired/frontend` media system, whose viewer stayed transparent when opened; `@trebired/frontend` 12.17.1 shows it.

## 1.3.0

- Replaced the local `ExpandableImage` and `GoogleMapEmbed` with the `@trebired/frontend` 12.16 media system and deleted the application copies. The package versions add a portal, a focus trap, focus restore, a reference counted scroll lock and a cleaned close timer, none of which the local implementations had.
- Enabled the `media` system in `.trebired/frontend/systems.ts`.

## 1.2.3

- Removed the `frontend ready` boot log from the client entry. It was an application log line duplicated across sites for a milestone the framework does not report, so it told a visitor's console nothing the site owns.

## 1.2.2

- Regenerated the Code Discipline alias map for the added `.trebired/i18n/config.ts`. 1.2.1 shipped without it, so `code-discipline check` failed on a fresh clone even though the build succeeded.

## 1.2.1

- Fixed every page throwing `i18n-local-translator-unbound` on hydration. 1.2.0 moved the bundler options into `.trebired/bundler/config.ts`, which sources the supported languages from `.trebired/i18n/config.ts`, and this repo had no such file. The client build therefore ran with no languages and left every `createLocalTranslator()` call unrewritten, while the SSR build kept passing its own list, so the served HTML looked correct and only the browser failed. Added `.trebired/i18n/config.ts` and made it the single source: the SSR render now takes the languages resolved from that config instead of a second list in application code.

## 1.2.0

### Languages

- Changed language selection from a stored preference applied in the browser to locale-prefixed URLs. Czech is served at `/` and English under `/en`, each as its own prerendered document with its own `<html lang>`, title, description, canonical URL, and `hreflang` set, so both languages are separately indexable. `@trebired/frontend` owns the boot script that resolves the visitor's locale before first paint and the `LocaleProvider` that keeps the server render and hydration in agreement, so the language is no longer corrected after the page is visible.
- Removed the app-local language wrappers `shared/lang/detect.ts` and `shared/lang/store.ts`. Detection, persistence, and the active locale now come from `@trebired/frontend`; `shared/lang/policy.ts` declares only this site's locale list, labels, and flags.

### SEO

- Added `@trebired/seo` for canonical URLs, `hreflang` alternates, Open Graph and Twitter tags, JSON-LD, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml`, replacing the hand-assembled head tags in the removed `src/bin/frontend/shell.ts`.

### Brand

- Moved the favicons out of `src/frontend/public` into `src/brand` as the single SVG source per colour scheme. `@trebired/frontend` rasterizes them at build time into the ICO and PNG sizes and emits the head links, so no generated icon is committed.

### Deployment

- Added `netlify.toml` declaring `bun run build` and `dist` as the publish directory, so the deploy no longer depends on build settings stored in the host's UI.

### Trebired packages

- Declared `.trebired/bundler/config.ts` through the bundler's own `defineConfig` with a `forVersion`. It was a typed options object at the package config path, so it carried no version and nothing could detect drift against the installed bundler. It now owns `build.clientOutDir` and `build.publicPath`; the application-owned defines and language list moved to `src/bin/frontend/options.ts`.
- Removed the local `withDirectoryIndexFallback` from the dev server. `@trebired/bundler` 5.12.1 resolves a directory request to its `index.html`, which is what the wrapper existed to do.
- Updated the Trebired packages to the current fleet: `bundler` 5.13.1, `frontend` 12.15.0, `seo` 0.4.0, `startup` 0.7.1, `i18n` 0.6.1, `code-discipline` 7.2.0, `configs` 0.4.0, `logger` 2.7.1, `utils` 0.9.4, and brought every `.trebired/*` `forVersion` up with them.
- Updated `@trebired/frontend` to 12.12.7 earlier in this line, fixing a broken dev server and build: the 12.12.5 payload had `dist/config/scss.js` importing `./tones.js` without shipping that file, so every build failed at discovery.

## 1.1.3

### Appearance

- Removed the "Detail" link from the accommodation cards on the home page. The card is already a link, and the arrow badge on its image carries the same affordance, so the label was redundant.
- Fixed the "CO NABÍZÍME" cards stacking one per row on phones. They now use a two-column grid there, matching the "CO JE K DISPOZICI" cards, and keep the three-column desktop layout.
- Fixed a light strip down the right edge of every page. `@trebired/frontend`'s reset sets `scrollbar-gutter: stable` on `html`, which permanently reserves scrollbar-width space that only `html`'s own background paints — so it showed through beside every full-bleed dark section. The site does not use the framework's scroll-locking modal that the reservation exists for, so it is now off, and the scrollbar itself is themed with a transparent track.
- Moved the language switcher onto the same row as the phone number in the mobile menu, aligned right, instead of below it.

### Navigation

- Fixed the hydration mismatch warnings React logged for the header and footer on every page load. `hydrateRoot()` only schedules hydration, but `bindFrontendRuntime()` ran synchronously at the end of the client entry, stamping `data-tbf-soft-redirect-bound` and `mode="static"` onto the DOM before React committed. Chrome hydration now resolves through `hydrateChromeRoots()`, and the runtime binding plus the content island mount wait for that commit.

### Trebired packages

- Updated `@trebired/frontend` to 12.12.5 and `@trebired/bundler` to 5.9.0. `@trebired/logger` stays pinned to `2.5.32`: `@trebired/bundler` and `@trebired/logger-adapter` still ship a bundled logger config targeting `2.5.26` against a `^2.5.32` range, so unpinning would resolve `2.6.2` and trip the version guard.

## 1.1.2

### Navigation

- Fixed `canonicalPath()` and `getAccommodationByPath()` matching paths by exact string, with no trailing-slash normalization. A cold load of an accommodation URL arriving with a trailing slash (as several static hosts produce via a redirect) silently missed the route lookup and rendered the home page instead, while the server had correctly rendered the accommodation page — a genuine content mismatch that React's hydration surfaced as a hard error and regenerated the tree client-side. `canonicalPath()` now strips a trailing slash before every lookup.

## 1.1.1

### Trebired packages

- Updated `@trebired/frontend` to 12.12.3 (from 12.11.1), across three collaborative bugfix rounds with the package maintainer: `bindPopstate()` no longer mistakes a same-page hash click for a real navigation, `rehydrate()` no longer races a still-hydrating island's soft-redirect links, `LiveIslandMount`'s `data-live-island-hydrated` guard no longer goes permanently stale when an app points its `rootId` at the SPA's own content selector, and the icon binder now respects the same unhydrated-island guard the other binders already had.

### Navigation

- Fixed the SSR entry never wiring up server-side icon rendering, which shipped every icon as an empty `<i>` element in the server-rendered HTML (invisible until diffed against the client's hydrated output). Server-rendered routes now wrap in `withIconServerRenderer()`, seeded from the same icon spec set the client build uses.
- Fixed the content island (`content_island.tsx`) reading its route from a JSON state script that only the first page load ever populated; it now reads `window.location.pathname` directly, so it can't go stale after the first soft-navigation.

## 1.1.0

### Navigation

- Migrated page navigation to `@trebired/frontend`'s SPA soft-navigation system, replacing the hand-rolled router. Page switches now fetch and swap through `configureSpa()`/`onPageChange()` instead of a client-side React router, with `Header` and `Footer` hydrated once as persistent roots across navigations.
- Added a build-time-only SSR path that renders each route to real HTML at build time (via `@trebired/bundler`'s `bundle()` with `environment: "node"`), so the SPA system has server-rendered markup to fetch and swap in, rather than an empty shell.
- Fixed same-page section links firing an unwanted network request and progress bar on click, caused by a same-document fragment click triggering a real `popstate` in Chromium; same-page hash clicks now scroll directly instead of round-tripping through a soft-redirect.
- Enabled `design.scrollBehavior: "smooth"` in `.trebired/frontend/config.ts`.

### Appearance

- Removed the eyebrow label from every section and replaced it with a proper full-width title, fixing the "why us" section (previously rendering only the eyebrow, with the title invisible due to a CSS rule ordering bug) and the "GET IN TOUCH" / accommodation titles, which were squeezed into a grid column instead of spanning full width.
- Replaced every CSS `margin` with `gap` on a flex/grid container, using `@trebired/frontend`'s `--tbf-gap-*` tokens throughout.
- Fixed the benefit cards to lay out two per row on mobile instead of one, and removed their hover state.
- Fixed the hero title overflowing its container on narrow viewports.

### Trebired packages

- Updated `@trebired/bundler`, `@trebired/frontend`, `@trebired/i18n`, and `@trebired/startup`, and declared the previously-undeclared `@trebired/utils` and `@trebired/env` dependencies explicitly.
- Updated `@trebired/code-discipline` to 7.1.3, which fixes its own logger version-guard mismatch.
- Moved `@trebired/logger` into `dependencies`, alongside `@trebired/startup` and `@trebired/env`. It keeps its exact `2.5.32` pin and matching `overrides` entry, since `@trebired/bundler` and `@trebired/logger-adapter` (pulled in by `frontend`/`startup`/`env`) still ship a bundled logger config that only tolerates `2.5.x`.

## 1.0.0

### Build and structure

- Migrated the site from Vite, Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and a hand-authored `index.html` to `@trebired/bundler`, with colocated SCSS and build-time generated route shells.
- Restructured the repository to the Trebired application layout: `src/frontend`, `src/bin`, `src/types`, with package configuration under `.trebired/`.
- Added static shell generation. The build writes one HTML file per route, each carrying its own Czech or English `title` and `description` from the single route table in `src/frontend/shared/routes.ts`.
- Added `src/bin/dev.ts` and `src/bin/frontend/build.ts` as the only entrypoints, replacing `vite.config.ts` and the Vite dev server.
- Added `bun run verify`, which runs the discipline check, the typecheck, and the production build in that order.

### Trebired packages

- Adopted `@trebired/frontend` as the design system: palette, semantics, breakpoints, component tokens, theme, popover, icons, and typography all come from `.trebired/frontend/`.
- Adopted `@trebired/i18n` colocated translators. Every component that owns copy has an `i18n/cs.ts` and `i18n/en.ts` beside it, resolved statically at build time, replacing `react-i18next` and the central resource files.
- Adopted `@trebired/startup` for the dev server: port preflight, ordered bootstrap subsystems, graceful shutdown on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`/`SIGHUP`, and configured startup messages.
- Adopted `@trebired/utils` for product identity, port and environment reading, and value helpers, replacing hand-written equivalents.
- Adopted `@trebired/code-discipline` with the `@trebired/configs` preset, enforcing file and function sizes, comment removal, formatting, hash-alias imports, and a banned pattern for the product hostname.
- Read the product hostname from `package.json` through `readProductIdentity()`, injected as a build-time constant, so it appears in exactly one place in the repository.

### Appearance

- Moved button geometry, tones, transition, and typography into `components.surfaces.button`. The application ships no button CSS.
- Moved page title, section title, and eyebrow label typography into `components.typography.heading.variants`, including their responsive steps.
- Moved the responsive container padding ramp into `components.typography.container.px`.
- Replaced `lucide-react` with the Remix Icon set that `@trebired/frontend` ships, registered through a build-time static icon cache so the site needs no icon endpoint.
- Replaced the Google Fonts link with self-hosted Geist through the bundler font pipeline, eliminating a third-party request on every page load.
- Replaced the `flag-icons` dependency with the locale flags `@trebired/frontend` emits for the configured countries.
- Added the Bučovice map backdrop to the accommodation hero sections, shared with the home hero through one component.
- Removed `src/frontend/css/` entirely. The base reset, page paint, container, anchor offset, and screen-reader utility all come from the package.

### Removed

- Removed the shadcn button, `class-variance-authority`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `tailwind-merge`, `tw-animate-css`, `lucide-react`, `flag-icons`, `react-i18next`, `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `tailwindcss`, and `postcss`.
- Removed `index.html`, `vite.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `components.json`, and `src/globals.css`.
- Stopped tracking `dist/` build output.

### Documentation and licensing

- Added README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and CHANGELOG.md following the Trebired documentation standard.
- Licensed the project under the MIT License, with the copyright holder matching `package.json#author`.

## 0.1.0

- Released the original site: Vite, React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn components, and `react-i18next`, with a hand-authored `index.html` and a single global stylesheet.
