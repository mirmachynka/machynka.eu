machynka.eu is the public website of MACHYNKA s.r.o. The website owns the published pages, the route and metadata table, the Czech and English copy, and the static build output. MACHYNKA s.r.o. owns the business, the accommodation, the photography, and the contact details the website displays; the operator owns the hosting and the domain. The website does not own booking, payment, availability, guest records, or any server-side state; it is static and holds no data.

machynka.eu is a Trebired product, licensed under the MIT License. It is open source.

## Install

Bun 1 or later.

```sh
bun i
```

## Quick Start

```sh
bun run dev
```

The dev server builds the client bundle, generates one HTML shell per route, and serves `dist/` on port 3000. Set `PORT` to use another port.

Production build:

```sh
bun run build
```

`dist/` is a static directory. Serve it with any static host.

## Concepts

### Frontend-only application

The application has no backend. `src/bin/frontend/build.ts` produces the client bundle and the route shells; nothing runs at request time. `src/bin/dev.ts` exists for local preview and is not a production server.

### Route shells

`src/frontend/shared/routes.ts` is the single route table. It holds the canonical path for every page, the legacy path aliases, and the per-language `title` and `description`. The build reads it through `allRoutePaths()` and `metaFor()` and writes one `index.html` per route per locale, so each page ships its own metadata in each language.

### Colocated translations

Every component that owns copy has an `i18n/cs.ts` and `i18n/en.ts` beside it. Components read them through `createLocalTranslator(import.meta.url, lang)` from `@trebired/i18n`, which `@trebired/bundler` resolves statically at build time. There is no central resource file and no runtime translation loading.

### Design tokens

Button, popover, palette, icon, and theme values come from `.trebired/frontend/config.ts` and generate `dist/css/frontend.css`. The application ships one stylesheet, for the hero, and defines no CSS classes: layout and spacing are package utilities, and everything a utility cannot express hangs off a data attribute on the element that owns it. Component appearance that `@trebired/frontend` owns is configured, never overridden in application CSS.

## Configuration

| File | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `.trebired/bundler/config.ts` | Frontend directory, build output directory, public path |
| `.trebired/seo/config.ts` | Site URL, locales, locale strategy, robots policy, sitemap defaults |
| `.trebired/frontend/config.ts` | Palette, semantics, component tokens, systems, fonts, icon mode, light and dark favicon |
| `.trebired/startup/config.ts` | Startup messages, port requirement, shutdown timeout |
| `.trebired/code-discipline/config.ts` | Enforcement presets and banned patterns |

`PORT` selects the dev server port and defaults to `3000`.

## Runtime

Bun runs the build and the dev server. The published output is static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets; the browser is the only runtime the visitor needs. Every page is served from one URL in both languages. The language menu re-renders the page in place without a reload or a URL change, and a boot script in the head applies the visitor's saved language before first paint, so it is never corrected after the page is visible. English documents are also prerendered under `/en` with their own `<html lang>`, title, description, canonical URL, and `hreflang` set, for search engines only; visitors are never sent there. `netlify.toml` declares the build command and publish directory, so the host needs no build settings of its own.

## What It Does Not Do

- No booking, reservation, availability, or payment handling. Reservations are taken by phone or e-mail.
- No backend, database, session, or user account.
- No content management interface. Copy changes are code changes in the colocated `i18n` folders.
- No analytics, tracking, or cookie consent layer.
- No email delivery. Contact runs through the published phone numbers and addresses.
